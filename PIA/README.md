#  NUTRITION PLAN GENERATOR
For this integrative learning project I decided to make a program that helps you get a nutrition plan according to your health and preferences, I think that it is a functional program because a lot of people is struggling with overweight and most of them don't have access to a nutritionist; the program gives you 3 options for you to decide the goal, then it asks you for your data to obtain your BMI and then tells you what it is and what is your condition, finally it gives you the option so that you decide if you want your plan vegetarian or normal.
###  OPTIONS:
The 3 goal options are:
  - Loss Weight
  - Gain muscle
  - maintain
  
Then it asks you for:
  - Your name
  - Your weight
  - Your height
  - Your age
 
It gives you:
  - Your condition 
  - Your BMI

Finally you decide haow do you want your plan
  - Normal
  - Vegetarian
